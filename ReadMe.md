 # **Border War**

## Objective

Create a browser-based game that models the card game “War” allowing the user to decide which deck to root for.

## Game Rules
The deck is divided evenly between both teams. Each team then displays a card. Whichever card displayed is higher than the other, both cards are put into the winner's deck. If there is a tie, three cards are removed from each team's deck and then a 4th card is turned to determine a winner of that hand. The game ends when one deck runs out of cards.

## Motivation

There are two reasons I wanted to create the game of war. It’s the first card game I ever learned from my grandmother. It’s what spawned my interest in learning many more card games, and it’s the first game I teach someone that wants to learn how to play any game of cards. The second reason is due to my theme of KU vs. Mizzou. As a KU grad, the rivalry with Mizzou runs deep so to display it in a card game was special to create.

## Technology Implemented:

## Next Steps:

* Add audio for when either Mizzou or KU wins. The audio played would be the winning school’s fight song.
* Make the game compatible with mobile devices
* Add two divs to display the hostage cards when war occurs.
