 # **Border War**




## Objective

Create a browser-based game that models the card game “War” allowing the user to decide which deck to root for.

## To Play The Game:

## Motivation

There are two reasons I wanted to create the game of war. It’s the first card game I ever learned from my grandmother. It’s what spawned my interest in learning many more card games, and it’s the first game I teach someone that wants to learn how to play any game of cards. The second reason is due to my theme of KU vs. Mizzou. The Border Battle is a historical rivalry and to display it in a card game just adds another dimension to it.

## Next Steps:

Add audio for when either Mizzou or KU wins. The audio played would be the winning school’s fight song.
Make the game compatible on mobile devices
Add two divs to display the hostage cards when war occurs.
Add a counter to keep track of the number of cards in each deck
